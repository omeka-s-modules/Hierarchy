# Hierarchy

Create hierarchies of resources for organization and display. Each hierarchy can contain multiple nested groupings, and each grouping may optionally contain objects from a selected item set.

This module adds a place to create and edit hierarchies, site-specific settings for display, a resource page block (for items and item sets), and a site page block to display hierarchies. Hierarchies and their groupings have custom browse pages that show all items contained within that grouping and, optionally, within its children groupings. 

Some Omeka S themes may need to be updated to work with this modules.
